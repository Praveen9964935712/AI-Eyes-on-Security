# 🔗 ALERT SYSTEM INTEGRATION - FIXED

## Problem Fixed
**Issue:** Alerts detected by multi-camera surveillance (port 5002) were not showing in main dashboard (port 3000/localhost:3000/dashboard)

**Root Cause:** The two systems weren't integrated - surveillance system only sent emails, didn't save to MongoDB

**Solution:** Modified `alert_manager.py` to save all alerts to MongoDB database so they appear in dashboard

---

## ✅ What Was Changed

### File: `backend/app/services/alert_manager.py`

#### Added Database Integration:
```python
# Import MongoDB models
from database.models import AlertModel

# Initialize in __init__
self.alert_model = AlertModel()

# Save to database in send_alert()
db_alert_id = self.alert_model.create_alert(
    camera_id=alert_data.get('camera_id', 'unknown'),
    alert_type=alert_data['type'],
    message=alert_data.get('description', ''),
    severity=alert_data['severity'],
    image_path=alert_data.get('image_path')
)
```

---

## 📊 Alert Flow (Now Complete)

```
Camera → Detection → Alert Manager → [MongoDB + Email + Dashboard]
                                      ↓         ↓         ↓
                                   Database  SendGrid   UI
```

### Before Fix:
```
Intruder Detected → Email ✅
                  → Dashboard ❌ (empty)
```

### After Fix:
```
Intruder Detected → Email ✅
                  → Dashboard ✅ (shows alert)
                  → Database ✅ (persisted)
```
